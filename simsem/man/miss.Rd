\usage{
miss(cov = 0, pmMCAR = 0, pmMAR = 0, nforms = 0, itemGroups = list(0), 
timePoints = 1, twoMethod = 0, prAttr = 0, package="default", 
ignoreCols = 0, threshold = 0, covAsAux = TRUE, logical = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
	\item{cov}{Column indices of any normally distributed covariates used in the data set.}
    \item{pmMCAR}{Decimal percent of missingness to introduce completely at random on all variables.}
    \item{pmMAR}{Decimal percent of missingness to introduce using the listed covariates as predictors.}
    \item{nforms}{The number of forms for planned missing data designs, not including the shared form.}
    \item{itemGroups}{List of lists of item groupings for planned missing data forms. Without this, items will be divided into groups sequentially (e.g. 1-3,4-6,7-9,10-12)}
    \item{timePoints}{Number of timepoints items were measured over. For longitudinal data, planned missing designs will be implemented within each timepoint.}
    \item{twoMethod}{With missing on one variable: vector of (column index, percent missing). Will put a given percent missing on that column in the matrix to simulate a two method planned missing data research design. With missing on two or more variables: list of (column indices, percent missing). }
	\item{prAttr}{Probability (or vector of probabilities) of an entire case being removed due to attrition at a given time point. See \code{\link{imposeMissing}} for further details.}
    \item{package}{TBA}
	\item{ignoreCols}{The columns not imposed any missing values for any missing data patterns} 
	\item{threshold}{The threshold of covariates that divide between the area to impose missing and the area not to impose missing. The default threshold is the mean of the covariate.}
	\item{covAsAux}{If \code{TRUE}, the covariate listed in the object will be used as auxiliary variables when putting in the model object. If \code{FALSE}, the covariate will be included in the analysis.}
	\item{logical}{A matrix of logical values (\code{TRUE/FALSE}). If a value in the dataset is corresponding to the \code{TRUE} in the logical matrix, the value will be missing.}
	\item{\dots}{TBA}
