\title{ 
Impose MAR, MCAR, and planned missingness on a data set
}
\description{
Function imposes missing values on a data based on the known missing data types,
including MCAR, MAR, and planned.
}
\usage{
imposeMissing(data.mat, covs = NULL, pmMCAR = NULL, pmMAR = NULL, nforms = NULL, itemGroups = NULL, twoMethod = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data.mat}{
    A raw data matrix
}
  \item{covs}{
    Column indices of any normally distributed covariates used in the data set. Will not be
    included in any removal procedure, and are required to impose MAR missing. 
}
  \item{pmMCAR}{
    Decimal percent of missingness to introduce completely at random on all variables.
}
  \item{pmMAR}{
    Decimal percent of missingness to introduce using the listed
    covariates as predictors. 
}
  \item{nforms}{
    The number of forms for planned missing data designs, not including
    the shared form.
}
  \item{itemGroups}{
    List of lists of item groupings for planned missing data forms. Without this,
    items will be divided into groups sequentially (e.g. 1-3,4-6,7-9,10-12)
}
  \item{twoMethod}{
    Vector of (percent missing, column index). Will put a given percent
    missing on that column in the matrix to simulate a two method
    planned missing data research design. 
}
}
\details{
Without specifying any any arguments, no missingness will be
introduced. Covariates are required to impose MAR missing.
}
\value{
A data matrix with \code{NA}s introduced in the way specified by the arguments.
