\title{ 
Impose MAR, MCAR, and planned missingness on a data set
}
\description{
Function imposes missing values on a data based on the known missing data types,
including MCAR, MAR, and planned.
}
\usage{
imposeMissing(data.mat, cov = 0, pmMCAR = 0, pmMAR = 0, nforms = 0, itemGroups = 0, twoMethod = 0, timePoints = 1, ignoreCols = 0, threshold = 0, logical = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data.mat}{
    Data to impose missing upon. Can be either a matrix or a data frame. 
}
  \item{cov}{
    Column indices of any normally distributed covariates used in the data set. Will not be
    included in any removal procedure, and are required to impose MAR missing. For other missing pattern, 
	the covs will be the columns not to be imposed the missing values.
}
  \item{pmMCAR}{
    Decimal percent of missingness to introduce completely at random on all variables.
}
  \item{pmMAR}{
    Decimal percent of missingness to introduce using the listed
    covariates as predictors. 
}
  \item{nforms}{
    The number of forms for planned missing data designs, not including
    the shared form.
}
  \item{itemGroups}{
    List of lists of item groupings for planned missing data forms. Without this,
    items will be divided into groups sequentially (e.g. 1-3,4-6,7-9,10-12)
}
  \item{twoMethod}{
    Vector of (column index, percent missing). Will put a given percent
    missing on that column in the matrix to simulate a two method
    planned missing data research design. 
}
 \item{timePoints}{
    Number of timepoints items were measured over. For longitudinal data, planned missing designs will be implemented within each timepoint. 
}
 \item{ignoreCols}{
    The columns not imposed any missing values for any missing data patterns 
} 
 \item{threshold}{
    The threshold of covariates that divide between the area to impose missing and the area not to impose missing. The default threshold is the mean of the covariate.
}
 \item{logical}{
    A matrix of logical values (\code{TRUE/FALSE}). If a value in the dataset is corresponding to the \code{TRUE} in the logical matrix, the value will be missing.
}
}
\details{
Without specifying any any arguments, no missingness will be
introduced. Covariates are required to impose MAR missing.
}
\value{
A data matrix with \code{NA}s introduced in the way specified by the arguments.
