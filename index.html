        <h1>simsem: SIMulated Structural Equation Modeling</h1>

<p>This R package has been developed for facilitating simulation and analysis of data within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. This package aims to help analysts create simulated data from hypotheses or analytic results from obtained data. The simulated data can be used for different purposes, such as power analysis, model fit evaluation, and planned missing design.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Building simulated sampling distribution for fit indices.</em> This package will help researchers tailor fit indices cutoffs based on a priori alpha level and a priori definition of trivial model misspecification. In other words, this package will help researchers simulate data based on their actual model with their defined trivial model misspecification. Then, the fit indices from the simulated data can be used to create empirical sampling distributions and find the fit indices cutoff based on the sampling distributions. Model parameters can be specified manually or obtained from the results of data analysis. If model parameters are obtained from the results of data analysis, this approach is also called the parametric bootstrap or Monte Carlo approach. The Bollen-Stine bootstrap approach for data generation is also available, as well as creating nonnormal distribution by Gaussian copula. </li>
<li><em>Power analysis.</em> This package will help analysts find power of both parameter estimates and model evaluation. This package can find power when data are missing. Missing data imposed into simulated data can be 1) missing completely at random (MCAR), 2) missing at random (MAR), 3) missing not at random (NMAR), and 4) planned missing data (<em>n</em>-form design or two-method design). Longitudinal missing data (i.e., attrition) can be modeled as a MCAR or MAR process. Missing data can be handled through multiple imputation of Full Information Maximum Liklihood. Sample size and percent missing can be varied continuously and power plots given values of sample size or percent missing can be built.</li>
<li><em>Methodological investigations.</em> This package can be used for methodological studies concerning SEM. Researchers can easily vary parameter values and model misspecification across parameters and easily summarize results from simulations. Nested models can be easily tested by comparing the results from two simulation runs. The powerful and flexible missing data options available in simsem make the package extremely useful in methodological investigations concerning SEM and missing data.</li>

</ol><h2>Announcements</h2>

<h3>[January 20, 2013] Latest Update: simsem, Version 0.5-0</h3>

<p>This version is available on KRAN only. Here is a list of major updates:</p>

<ol>
<li>The generate and model arguments for the sim function can take two formats: simsem template (as previous versions) and lavaan script (or lavaan parameter table or a list of arguments for the simulateData, lavaan, cfa, sem, or growth functions). See more details and the example scripts in the <a href="https://github.com/simsem/simsem/wiki/Vignette">vignette</a>.
<li>In the simsem template format, users can add exogenous covariates for data generation, which can take any distributions (or even dummy variables). The KA and GA arguments are added to the model function to account for the effects of exogenous covariates on indicators or factors respectively. Users need to create their own covariate data and add to the covData argument in the generate or sim functions.
<li>Nonnormal data can be created from Vale and Maurelli's (1983) method. Users can simply specify the skewness and kurtosis arguments in the bindDist function.
<li>All arguments that take characters will be case-insensitive.
</ol>

<h3>[December 30, 2012] Latest Update: simsem, Version 0.4-6</h3>

<p>This version is available on CRAN and KRAN. The Mair and colleagues (2012) method for nonnormally-distributed data generation is implemented. Users can specify any multivariate copula for data generation. Please check Example 12 in the vignette. The normally-distributed data are generated so that the common cases between two datasets with different sample size are replicated if the same random seed number is used (Thanks to Paul Johnson). We also make some internal codes to be more efficient and less time-consuming. Some error messages and documentations are updated. All examples in <em>simsemClassic</em> have been transcribed to the current <em>simsem</em>. Several minor bugs are fixed.</p>

<h2>Program</h2>

<p>The project is still under development. The package can be installed by copying this line into R:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("simsem")
</code></pre>

<p>If you are interested in the source code, please click <a href="https://github.com/simsem/simsem">here</a>.</p>

<p>You may install the recently developed test version from KRAN (KU R Archive Network) by 1) making sure that you have the <strong>lavaan</strong> and <strong>copula</strong> packages in your personal library, and 2) copying this line into R:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("simsem", repos="http://rweb.quant.ku.edu/kran", type="source")
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how to install simsemClassic (version 0.2-8 of simsem) from KRAN only:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("simsemClassic", repos="http://rweb.quant.ku.edu/kran", type="source")
</code></pre>
