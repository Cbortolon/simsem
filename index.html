        <h1>simsem: SIMulated Structural Equation Modeling</h1>

<p>This R package has been developed for facilitating simulation and analysis of data within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. This package aims to help analysts create simulated data from hypotheses or analytic results from obtained data. The simulated data can be used for different purposes, such as power analysis, model fit evaluation, and planned missing design.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Building simulated sampling distribution for fit indices.</em> This package will help researchers tailor fit indices cutoffs based on a priori alpha level and a priori definition of trivial model misspecification. In other words, this package will help researchers simulate data based on their actual model with their defined trivial model misspecification. Then, the fit indices from the simulated data can be used to create empirical sampling distributions and find the fit indices cutoff based on the sampling distributions. Model parameters can be specified manually or obtained from the results of data analysis. If model parameters are obtained from the results of data analysis, this approach is also called the parametric bootstrap or Monte Carlo approach. The Bollen-Stine bootstrap approach for data generation is also available, as well as creating nonnormal distribution by Gaussian copula. </li>
<li><em>Power analysis.</em> This package will help analysts find power of both parameter estimates and model evaluation. This package can find power when data are missing. Missing data imposed into simulated data can be 1) missing completely at random (MCAR), 2) missing at random (MAR), 3) missing not at random (NMAR), and 4) planned missing data (<em>n</em>-form design or two-method design). Longitudinal missing data (i.e., attrition) can be modeled as a MCAR or MAR process. Missing data can be handled through multiple imputation of Full Information Maximum Liklihood. Sample size and percent missing can be varied continuously and power plots given values of sample size or percent missing can be built.</li>
<li><em>Methodological investigations.</em> This package can be used for methodological studies concerning SEM. Researchers can easily vary parameter values and model misspecification across parameters and easily summarize results from simulations. Nested models can be easily tested by comparing the results from two simulation runs. The powerful and flexible missing data options available in simsem make the package extremely useful in methodological investigations concerning SEM and missing data.</li>
</ol><h2>Announcements</h2>

<h3>[October 15, 2012] Latest Update: simsem, Version 0.3-12</h3>

<p>This version is available on CRAN and KRAN. This version allows users to impose missing values by logistic regression approach. Users can write a script similar to regression equation in lavaan syntax such that (a) each line begins with the imposed variable, (b) '~' is used to represent 'is regressed by', and (c) each line ends with the linear combination of other variables or a constant, such as 'y1 ~ 0.3 + 0.2*y2 + 0.1*y3'. The logistic regression approach can be used with other types of missing data, such as missing completely at random. See the help page of the <strong>miss</strong> function for further details. We also fix minor bugs in parameter table generation.</p>

<h3>[September 26, 2012] Latest Update: simsem, Version 0.3-11</h3>

<p>This version is available on KRAN only. The <strong>getPowerFit</strong> and <strong>getPowerFitNested</strong> functions provide the power of traditional chi-square (absolute or difference) tests. The convergent status is recoded and expanded to account for improper correlation solutions. Most summary function family (e.g., <strong>summaryFit</strong> or <strong>summaryParam</strong>) provides an <em>improper</em> argument to include the replications providing improper solutions in the summary. The bugs on the simulation with varying sample size and on two-method designs have been fixed.</p>
