This package aims to help analysts create simulated data from their hypotheses or their analytic results from obtained data. The simulated data can be used for different purposes, such as power analysis, model fit evaluation, and planned missing design. This highlights of the current version is\r\n\r\n1. _Building simulated sampling distribution for fit indices._ This package will help researchers tailor their fit indices cutoff based on a priori alpha level and a priori definition of trivial model misspecification. In other words, this package will help researchers simulate data based on their actual model with their defined trivial model misspecification. Then, the fit indices from the simulated data can be used to create empirical sampling distribution and find the fit indices cutoff based on the sampling distribution. The actual parameters can be specified manually or obtained from the result of data analysis. If the actual parameters are obtained from the result of data analysis, this approach may be called parametric bootstrap or Monte Carlo approach. The Bollen-Stine bootstrap approach for data generation is also available, as well as creating nonnormal distribution by Gaussian copula. \r\n\r\n2. _Power analysis._ This package will help analysts find power of both parameter estimates and model evaluation. This package can find power when data are missing. Missing data imposed into simulated data can be 1) missing completely at random (MCAR), 2) missing at random (MAR), 3) missing not at random (NMAR), and 4) planned missing data (_n_-form design or two-method design). Longitudinal missing data (i.e., attrition) can be modeled as a MCAR or MAR process. Missing data can be handled through multiple imputation of Full Information Maximum Liklihood. Sample size and percent missing can be varied continuously and power plots given values of sample size or percent missing can be built.\r\n\r\n3. _Methodological investigations._ This package can be used for methodological studies concerning SEM. Researchers can easily vary parameter values and model misspecification across parameters and easily summarize results from simulations. Nested models can be easily tested by comparing the results from two simulation runs. The powerful and flexible missing data options available in simsem make the package extremely useful in methodological investigations concerning SEM and missing data.\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n\r\n### [July 06, 2012] Latest Update: simsem, Version 0.2-8\r\n\r\nThis version is available in both CRAN and KRAN. We have fixed some minor bugs in the program and move **indProd** and **residualCovariate** functions to the **semTools** package. Hopefully, this is the last version in the 0.2 family. Please look forward to see the huge update soon. The simsem wiki page can also be accessed directly from http://www.simsem.org \r\n\r\n### [June 22, 2012] Latest Update: simsem, Version 0.2-7\r\n\r\nThis version is only available in KRAN. We have fixed some minor bugs in the program. We also add four new examples about how to specify trivial misspecification (Example 22) and nested model comparison (Example 23, 24, and 25).\r\n\r\n## Developers\r\n[Sunthud Pornprasertmanit](http://people.ku.edu/~s044p855/)\r\n\r\nPatrick Miller\r\n\r\n[Alexander Schoemann] (https://sites.google.com/site/alexandermschoemann/home)\r\n\r\nTerry Jorgensen\r\n\r\nScott Drotar\r\n\r\n## Program\r\nThe project is still under development.
